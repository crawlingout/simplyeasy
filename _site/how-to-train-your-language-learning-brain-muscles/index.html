  <p><em><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Stimulate a pattern recognition engine in your brain. Practice understanding words instantly instead of storing &#39;word-translation&#39; pairs in your brain. Build up your &#39;grammatical intuition&#39; instead of memorizing grammar rules. Let the words that need to be remembered select themselves and most importantly, have fun.</em></p>

<p>Can you - effortlessly and without subtitles - understand a movie in the language you are trying to learn? If you&#39;ve been studying that language for more than a year and the answer is still &#39;no&#39;, you might be doing it wrong.</p>

<h3>How I failed to understand Americans</h3>

<p>I started learning English in high school. I spent many hours memorizing grammar rules and vocabulary. I did reasonably well on my exams, but I never tested my language skills in real life and when I finally did, it was a disaster.</p>

<p>When I got to college everyone was talking about <a href="http://j1visa.state.gov/programs/summer-work-travel">W &amp; T Program</a> for college students - living, working and traveling in the US for four months. Such a great opportunity to make money, improve English and have some adventure, so I decided to go to America.</p>

<p>I tried to prepare the best that I could, so in the months before my departure, I spent even more time memorizing vocabulary and studying grammar. Then, the big day came and I landed at JFK. I managed to tell the immigration officer why I was there and I was able to buy burgers and bus tickets. After a week, I even found a job and started working in a huge and incredibly awesome (seriously, I&#39;ve never seen anything like it) antique store in Ocean City, MD.</p>

<p>My new colleagues turned out to be really friendly. They took me in as one of them from the first day and talked to me all the time. Unfortunately, that was when my problems began. If what they said was more complex than a one-sentence instruction, I was not able to understand.</p>

<p>It was really frustrating. I felt lost and desperately wanted to become friends with them. I was incredibly lucky that they did not give up on me, despite the fact that the most common response to their first communication attempts with me, was a confused stare.</p>

<p>Later on, I realized that I knew most of the words and grammatical structures they used. I was just not able to process them correctly. It felt like they were speaking too fast. It was like knowing how to catch a tennis ball perfectly, but suddenly someone starts bombarding you with 10 balls per second and you drop all of them.</p>

<p>It became obvious that the language skills I acquired during high school were only good for passing exams. In order to understand a foreign language in real life, I needed a lot more than memorized vocabulary lists and grammar rules.</p>

<p>I started observing and analyzing what was going on in my head when someone was talking to me. I realized a couple of things.</p>

<h3>Adapting 'pattern-recognition engine' in your brain</h3>

<p>It was surprisingly hard to recognize words in the flow of speech from a native speaker. I&#39;m not talking about understanding the meaning of words - I mean recognizing individual words in utterances which to my ears sounded like &#39;weregonnabebusydealingwiththisthenextmonday&#39;. The pattern recognition engine in my brain was not trained for this and couldn&#39;t retain and understand it fast enough. It took one or two seconds until the sounds were recognized as specific words.</p>

<p>I had to focus really hard all the time, to the point of almost physical discomfort. I had terrible headaches. But, I was improving surprisingly fast. I went from <em>&quot;heh?&quot;</em> to <em>&quot;I hear you&quot;</em> in about a month. That month made me realize that recognizing words is a skill that needs to be specifically practiced.</p>

<h3>Understanding instead of translating</h3>

<p>I was translating words in my head, but I was not able to understand them instantly. Here is the difference: connecting the word to its equivalent in your native language versus getting the meaning directly. For example, imagine something fast when you hear the Spanish word &#39;r√°pido&#39;, just &#39;feeling&#39; the speed without needing to remember the word &#39;fast&#39;.</p>

<p>The problem is that the mental process of connecting words to their equivalent in your mother tongue is not efficient enough when it comes to fluent speech. Unfortunately, this is the process we are conditioned to use - it is wired into our brains by the most popular methods of learning vocabulary: flashcards and vocabulary lists. I realized that understanding sentences &#39;directly&#39; was another skill that had to be specifically trained.</p>

<h3>Implicit learning instead of memorizing grammar rules</h3>

<p>I spent so many hours studying grammar rules. I memorized charts with tenses. <em>If the action started in the past and continued up to the present</em>... rules like this turned out to be useless in real conversations. They are far too complex to handle in real time. Trying to consciously apply them slows you down and interrupts flow. You need to be able to use your procedural memory and perform without conscious awareness, similar to riding a bike.</p>

<p>In theory, you should be able to &quot;internalize&quot; memorized grammar rules by practicing, but it never happened for me. I was never able to transform the explicit knowledge of complex rules into a skill. It was like learning to walk from a book and constantly thinking about &#39;putting one foot in front of you while swinging the opposite hand back and transferring your center of gravity diagonally&#39;. I started improving only after I began trying to walk the language without thinking about it too much and worrying about falling down too often. </p>

<p>You can develop the ability to use grammar intuitively without explicit knowledge of rules by hearing, reading and imitating various grammatical patterns so many times they get stuck in your brain. Absorb as much authentic input as you can. If you want to learn English, watch at least three episodes of Friends every day. You might not understand half of the first season but after 182nd episode you will &#39;feel it&#39; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Krashen">Stephen Krashen</a> calls it the &quot;feeling for grammaticality&quot;).</p>

<p>Like many others, I can speak and write in my mother tongue without any explicit knowledge of its grammar. Most people assume that studying grammar rules is a necessary part of learning a foreign language - I&#39;ve never understood why. Even Krashen says that <em>&quot;Language acquisition does not require extensive use of conscious grammatical rules&quot;</em> (you can read his super-interesting book here: <a href="http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf">Principles and Practice in Second Language Acquisition [PDF]</a>).</p>

<h3>Improved learning?</h3>

<p>Now I want to learn Spanish. I went through <em>Pimsleur Spanish</em> audio lessons some time ago which gave me something to start with (in my opinion the Pimsleur method is one of the best methods you can use to learn the basics). However, when I tried to watch Spanish TV shows in order to test my ability to understand, I was barely able to catch a word now and then.</p>

<p>Most people bow to The Holy Pair of Grammar and Vocabulary and when they fail to understand they assume it&#39;s because they don&#39;t know enough vocabulary and/or grammar. Many times this is not the case and I&#39;ve often tested this theory with something I like to call &#39;The Newsroom test&#39;.</p>

<p>I ask friends willing to be my guinea pigs to watch the opening scene of HBO&#39;s <em>The Newsroom</em>. They say they can&#39;t understand it. We watch it again, but this time, I pause after each sentence and make them watch the same sentence again and again. When necessary, I say that sentence myself and I pronounce it slowly and clearly with a long pause after each word. The result is always the same: multiple aha! moments and a surprise after they realize how many of the words they actually know, despite the fact they failed to recognize them the first time. They just never trained their understanding muscles.</p>

<p>In order to be good at something, you need to practice that specifically. Since my bike racing days, I know that if you want to be a decent climber, you need to climb. Running and doing squats is not specific enough. It will improve your aerobic endurance and give you some leg strength, but you will not be able to compete with the guys who spent the whole spring on their bikes climbing hills. In order to keep up with real Spaniards, I need to practice not just the exam-passing skills, but also the specific skills needed for fast, uninterrupted conversations with native speakers.</p>

<p>I remember how watching American TV shows and movies helped me with English. I strictly avoided subtitles, but I listened to each incomprehensible sentence again and again until I finally figured it out. I progressed from barely understanding easy shows like Friends, to effortlessly watching difficult ones like HBO&#39;s Oz. Now I need to do something like that with Spanish. TV shows are still too hard for me, so I have begun experimenting with audio-books. The most efficient way I&#39;ve discovered so far is to get both audio and text versions of a really interesting book and follow this procedure:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Start listening to the audio without reading the text. The &#39;without reading&#39; part is important - you want to stimulate the part of the brain responsible for recognizing words in sounds (listening <strong>while</strong> reading would be like training for a cycling race on a motorbike). Try to catch as much as you can. When you get lost, pause the audio.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the part you just listened to and figure out the incomprehensible parts. Try to guess the meaning of unknown words. I used to look up unknown words in a dictionary, but it was slow and annoying so I made myself a simple app, which allows me to just highlight words and have them instantly translated (you can try <a href="http://icanunderstand.eu/">the app</a> here but you can also use dictionary in your Kindle or whatever alternative you prefer).</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to the same part again. Each time, try to keep listening for as long as you can. The goal is to expose your brain to uninterrupted sequences of speech, putting yourself under the time pressure to stimulate your ability to understand words instantly.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to pronounce the sentence you just heard and try to imitate the speaker (I plan to add sound recording into <a href="http://icanunderstand.eu/">the app</a> so I can hear myself and compare my pronunciation with the native speaker).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I do this at least an hour every day. I need to feed my brain with a lot of Spanish in order to build up my &#39;grammatical intuition&#39;. I really like what Michael Erard (the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Babel-No-More-Extraordinary-Language-ebook/dp/B004T4KXXC/">Babel No More: The Search for the World&#39;s Most Extraordinary Language Learners</a>) says: &quot;<em>One learns grammar from language, not language from grammar</em>&quot; - that&#39;s exactly what I am trying to do.</p>

<p>I am exposed to hundreds of words in every session. I don&#39;t try to remember all of them.  Actually, I don&#39;t try that hard to remember any of them. I just let the words select themselves - the most useful words are the ones that are repeated so often that I remember them without too much effort. As I am gradually becoming familiar with high-frequency words, my learning capacity is freed for the less common ones. I believe that throwing a lot of input at my memory and letting the most important stuff stick gives me more value for the effort than memorizing lists of words from textbooks.</p>

<h3>Use the language to have fun</h3>

<p>Some people enjoy studying languages, but I am not one of those people. For me, the language is just a tool. I want to have it at my disposal, but I do not particularly enjoy studying it.</p>

<p>One of the reasons learning with audio-books works for me is that it does not feel like studying. When I memorized words from flashcards I had to force myself to sustain the self-inflicted torture in order to progress towards the big goal in the distant future. It took a lot of willpower and fighting acute boredom and sleepiness is not very helpful when you want to remember something. </p>

<p>With books, the motivation is more immediate. I get absorbed by a story, it makes me curious, even thrilled... I am not studying the language, I am just using it to find out more about the fate of the hero I care about and when I encounter a new word and have to guess it or look it up, I&#39;m immediately rewarded by revealing another little part of the story. The word is connected to a vivid image, emotions... and I often remember it without any effort.</p>

<p>Many unknown or half-learned words can be guessed from context. When I hear that &#39;fleeing thief looked over his <em>hombro</em>&#39; I can be pretty sure it means &#39;shoulder&#39;. This way, I remember it more easily than words memorized from a vocabulary list. Also, the ability to guess a word makes me feel good about myself - what could be a better motivation?</p>

<p>The most important thing about this way of developing my &#39;language-learning brain muscles&#39; is that it&#39;s fun. For a lazy person like me, this is crucial - it is the only way I am able to keep doing that long enough to actually learn the language.</p>
